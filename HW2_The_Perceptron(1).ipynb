        "**A.** Surprisingly, the highest accuracy on the test dataset is not always achieved by using the entire training dataset. For example, training on 50% of the dataset yields an accuracy of 73%, while using 100% of the dataset yields only 71% accuracy with a learning rate of 0.05 and 20 epochs. This phenomenon suggests that when using the entire dataset, overfitting may occur because the model memorizes the training instances rather than learning generalizable patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "**B.** Overfitting may be the cause of the phenomenon whereby the second run uses more training data but achieves lower accuracy than the first. When a model learns to memorize the training data rather than drawing generalizations from it, this is known as overfitting. Here, expanding the size of the training dataset (as in the second run) could result in overfitting and poor performance of the model on unknown data. This highlights how crucial it is to strike the ideal balance between the quantity of training data and the generalization ability of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**C.** It may be difficult to achieve greater accuracy (above 80.0) by adjusting hyperparameters alone, particularly for basic models such as the perceptron. Since the perceptron is a linear classifier, its effectiveness is constrained in situations where the data cannot be separated linearly or in which the relationships between features and labels are more complicated. More complex models or feature engineering methods may be required to reach greater accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**D.** More epochs of training aren't always worthwhile, particularly if the model begins to overfit or if the extra epochs don't substantially boost performance. More epochs of training may occasionally result in overfitting, a situation in which the model becomes overly specialized to the training set and struggles to generalize to new data. It's critical to keep an eye on the model's performance on a validation set and to cease training the model when overfitting is detected by a decline in validation performance. Additionally, there is a trade-off between training time and model performance because training for more epochs uses more computational resources and time.\n"
